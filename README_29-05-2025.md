# Titanic Survival Prediction with Logistic Regression

This project uses a Logistic Regression model to predict whether a passenger survived the Titanic disaster based on key features like age, sex, class, and fare. It also includes data visualizations to better understand survival patterns.

## File Structure

├── 29-05-2025.py # Main Python script with model training and visualization
├── titanic.csv # Dataset file (make sure it's in the same directory)
└── README.md # Project documentation

## Features Used

- Pclass – Passenger class (1st, 2nd, 3rd)
- Sex – Gender (male/female)
- Age – Age of the passenger
- Fare – Ticket fare

## Target Variable

- Survived – Whether the passenger survived (1) or not (0)

## How to Run

1. Ensure you have Python 3.x installed.
2. Install dependencies:
pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
3. Make sure `titanic.csv` is in the same folder as the script.
4. Run the Python script:

## Visualizations

The script will generate the following plots:

1. Survival Count by Sex – Bar chart showing how many males and females survived.
2. Age Distribution by Survival – Histogram showing the age distribution of survivors and non-survivors.
3. Fare Distribution by Class and Survival – Boxplot comparing fares across classes and survival status.
