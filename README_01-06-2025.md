# Model Comparison on Breast Cancer Dataset

This project compares the performance of four classification models on the Breast Cancer Wisconsin Diagnostic Dataset using key evaluation metrics and a visualization for comparison.

## Dataset

The dataset used is the **Breast Cancer Wisconsin Diagnostic Dataset**, which is available directly from `sklearn.datasets`.

## Models Used

- Random Forest Classifier
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
- Decision Tree Classifier
- Logistic Regression

## Evaluation Metrics

Each model is evaluated using the following performance metrics:

- Accuracy
- Precision
- Recall
- F1-Score

## Workflow

1. Load and explore the dataset
2. Split into training and testing sets (80% training, 20% testing)
3. Standardize features using `StandardScaler`
4. Train each model on the training data
5. Evaluate each model on the test data
6. Visualize the performance comparison using a bar chart

## Libraries Used

- scikit-learn
- pandas
- matplotlib
- seaborn

## How to Run

1. Install the required libraries (if not already installed):
pip install scikit-learn pandas matplotlib seaborn
2. Copy the code into a Python file,`01-06-2025.py`.
3. Run the file using:
python 01-06-2025.py

## Output

* Console output displaying performance metrics for each model
* Bar chart visualization comparing Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and F1-Score across all models

## Visualization

A grouped bar plot is generated to compare all four models across the selected metrics. This helps in understanding which model performs best overall and for specific criteria.
