# Wine Classification using Decision Tree Classifier

This project builds a Decision Tree Classifier to predict wine categories using the Wine dataset from `sklearn.datasets`. The dataset contains 13 chemical features of wines derived from three different cultivars. The model is trained, tested, evaluated for accuracy, and visualized.

## Dataset Description

- **Source**: `sklearn.datasets.load_wine()`
- **Features**: 13 chemical properties (e.g., alcohol, malic acid, ash, etc.)
- **Target**: Wine category (0, 1, or 2)

## Task Objectives

- Load and explore the wine dataset.
- Train a Decision Tree Classifier on the dataset.
- Evaluate the model using accuracy and classification metrics.
- Visualize the decision tree to interpret feature-based splits.

## How to Run

1. Make sure Python 3.x is installed on your system.
2. Install required packages:
pip install pandas matplotlib scikit-learn
3. Run the script:
python 31-05-2025.py

## Outputs

- **Accuracy Score**: Displayed in the console.
- **Classification Report**: Shows precision, recall, and F1-score per class.
- **Tree Visualization**: A plot of the trained decision tree showing feature splits and classes.

## Model Information

- **Model**: `DecisionTreeClassifier` from scikit-learn
- **Split**: 80% training / 20% testing
- **Random State**: 42 (for reproducibility)
