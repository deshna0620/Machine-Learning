# k-Nearest Neighbors Classifier on Iris Dataset

This project demonstrates how to train a k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN) classifier using the Iris flower dataset, and find the best value of `k` (number of neighbors) that gives the highest accuracy on a validation set. It also includes a visualization of accuracy vs. k.

## Dataset

We use the Iris dataset provided by scikit-learn, which includes 150 samples from three species of Iris:
- Iris Setosa
- Iris Versicolor
- Iris Virginica

Each sample has 4 features:
- Sepal length
- Sepal width
- Petal length
- Petal width

## Steps Performed

1. Load the dataset using `load_iris()`
2. Split the dataset into training (80%) and validation (20%) sets
3. Train k-NN classifiers for values of `k` from 1 to 20
4. Evaluate accuracy on the validation set for each `k`
5. Find the best value of `k` that gives the highest accuracy
6. Plot accuracy vs. `k` using matplotlib

## How to Run

### Requirements

Make sure the following Python libraries are installed:

```bash
pip install matplotlib scikit-learn
