# CIFAR-10 Image Classification using PyTorch

This project implements a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) in PyTorch to classify images from the CIFAR-10 dataset. It includes training, accuracy evaluation, and visualization of 5 sample predictions.

## Dataset

CIFAR-10 is a dataset of 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 classes:

- plane
- car
- bird
- cat
- deer
- dog
- frog
- horse
- ship
- truck

It is automatically downloaded using `torchvision.datasets`.

## Model Architecture

- Conv2D: 3 input channels → 16 filters (3x3), padding=1
- ReLU activation
- MaxPooling: 2x2
- Conv2D: 16 → 32 filters (3x3), padding=1
- ReLU activation
- MaxPooling: 2x2
- Flatten
- Fully Connected: 2048 → 128
- Fully Connected: 128 → 10
- Output: Class scores for 10 categories

## Requirements

Install required packages using pip:

```
pip install torch torchvision matplotlib
```

Or if using a specific Python version (e.g., Python 3.12):

```
"C:\Users\Neeraj kumar gothi\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python312\python.exe" -m pip install torch torchvision matplotlib
```

## How to Run

Navigate to the project folder and run the script:

```
python cifar10_classifier.py
```

## Output

- Training loss is printed every 100 batches
- Final test accuracy is printed after training
- A visualization of 5 sample predictions is saved as a single subplot figure

Saved file:

```
cifar10_sample_predictions_28-06-2025.png
```

Each subplot shows:
- Predicted class (P: class_name)
- Actual class (A: class_name)

## Sample Output

```
[Epoch 5, Batch 100] loss: 1.301
Finished Training

Test Accuracy: 64.35%
```

## Notes

- The model is trained for 5 epochs. You can increase this for better accuracy.
- GPU support can be added using `torch.cuda` if available.
- All predictions are visualized using subplots in a single figure.
