# Iris Flower Classification using PyTorch

This project implements a basic FeedForward Neural Network using PyTorch to classify Iris flowers based on four input features. It also includes visualization of training loss over epochs.

## Dataset

The Iris dataset is a built-in dataset from `sklearn.datasets` and includes:
- Sepal length
- Sepal width
- Petal length
- Petal width

The target is to classify the flower into one of three species:
- Setosa
- Versicolor
- Virginica

## Model Architecture

- Input Layer: 4 neurons (for the 4 features)
- Hidden Layer: 10 neurons with ReLU activation
- Output Layer: 3 neurons (for 3 classes)
- Loss Function: CrossEntropyLoss
- Optimizer: Adam

## Visualization

The script saves a line plot of the training loss over epochs using `matplotlib`.

Saved figure:

## Requirements

Install the necessary libraries using pip:
pip install torch torchvision torchaudio
pip install scikit-learn matplotlib


## Output

- Console: Prints loss every 10 epochs and final test accuracy.
- Image: Saves a plot of training loss named `iris_training_loss_25-06-2025.png`.

Example console output:
Epoch 100/100, Loss: 0.0562
Test Accuracy: 96.67%
