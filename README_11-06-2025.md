# Breast Cancer Prediction: Model Comparison

This project performs model comparison for predicting breast cancer using the Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) dataset.

## Key Highlights:
- Multiple classification models evaluated:
  - Logistic Regression
  - Decision Tree
  - Random Forest
  - Support Vector Machine (SVM)
  - K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
- Hyperparameter tuning with GridSearchCV
- Performance Metrics:
  - **F1-Score**
  - **ROC AUC Score**
- ROC Curve plotted and saved
- Final leaderboard generated based on F1-Score

## Outputs:
- `roc_curves_11-06-2025.png`: ROC Curve plot
- Console Output: Final Leaderboard sorted by F1-Score and ROC AUC

## How to Run:

```bash
python 11-06-2025.py
